# Black Jack in Javascript

I did this little project after watching a Tutorial. <br>
Tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMYCWccL-3U <br>
GitHub repo of the tutorial creator: https://github.com/ImKennyYip/black-jack <br>

In the future I would like to enhance this game by <br>
[] adding betting <br>
[] let the user choose card styles <br>
[] real-time score display <br>
