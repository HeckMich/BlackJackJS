# Black Jack in Javascript

I did this little project after watching a Tutorial.
Tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMYCWccL-3U
GitHub repo of the tutorial creator: https://github.com/ImKennyYip/black-jack

In the future I would like to enhance this game by
[] adding betting
[] let the user choose card styles
[] real-time score display
